# The C programming language

**a.k.a "The Kernighan & Ritchie / K&R"**

## What is this?
These are my 'assignments' which are given in the book. The repository serves more of a historic/archival purpose so that I can reflect and meander about code I wrote "once upon a time".

This book has gained a legendary status among C programmers, and so it is a logical starting point for the journey into things like reverse engineering. It is 'high level', yet close enough to the bare-metal to be concerned with things like manual memory allocation and preventing over/underflows etc.

Even though I 'knew' C back in 2002-2003, I've forgotten most of the useful parts. Since Borland C is no longer, and I lack enough functional knowledge to understand what's going on - I'm revisiting C before I meander into the land of x86-64 assembly language.

## What is my goal?
To gain a robust understanding of C, and to be able to manipulate hardware, interfaces and protocols on a byte-level by writing my own C programs.
