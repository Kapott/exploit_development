# The C programming language

**a.k.a "The Kernighan & Ritchie / K&R"**

These are my 'assignments' which are given in the book. It serves more of a historic/archival purpose so that I can reflect and meander about code I wrote "once upon a time".

This book has gained a legendary status among C programmers, and so it is a logical starting point for the journey into things like reverse engineering. It is 'high level', yet close enough to the bare-metal to be concerned with things like manual memory allocation and preventing over/underflows etc.
