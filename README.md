# Exploit development

Unlike the repo name might suggest, this is not a resource of any kind. It is simply a journal in git, documenting the route I take to master reverse engineering and exploit development. In this journey I'll read books, watch vids, take courses and pwn stuff. This git repo will simply contain the notes and assignments.

## A little background

I've been a professional software developer since 2007 and although I love programming (I think it's a beautiful amalgamation of creativity and logic) the mischievous side of me has always been drawn more towards breaking things (apart).

And so I set myself upon the course of becoming, at the very least, an adept reverse engineer and exploit developer. Soaking up information from official, unofficial and social sources.

## The route

The entire route isn't too clear yet. What I do know, is that C is the ideal 'go-between' for high- and low-level programming. So my journey starts with these resources, acquired from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/)

- [The C programming language - Kernighan & Ritchie (aka 'the K&R')](/the_c_programming_language/)
- [Computer Systems - A Programmer's Perspective](#na)
